# CMSC204_Lab2_Generic
This program is about converting DataSet into DataSetGen. Now it can work with any type that implements the Measurable interface. The DataSet class is a class designed to store and process objects of a specific type 
(example, BankAccount or BaseballPlayer). It has methods for: Adding elements, sum, maximum etc 
related to "measurable" data

CMSC204
Generic Lab

Start with the DataSet class and make it into a generic DataSetGen class.  This class should load any instance of a class that implements Measurable, and no classes that do not implement Measurable.  Test it with the DataSetTester.  
The DataSetTester uses the BankAccount and BaseballPlayer classes.  Do not change any of the classes except DataSet. 
Upload the original DataSet.java, DataSetTester.java, BankAccount.java, BaseballPlayer.java, and Measurable.java in a directory named GenericLab, into your repository in GitHub from Lab 1.  Upload DataSetGen.java into the same directory.
-	modify nothing except dataset.java
-	when you upload into github â€“ upload zip file.
